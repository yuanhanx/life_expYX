Calculate the country with the max life expectancy each year! 

```{r}

gapminder_unfiltered %>%  #use pipping
  group_by(year) %>%  #group by year since we want each year
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>% #select max lifeExp
  select(country, year) %>% #only print country and year
  arrange(year) #sort by year

```
